        <strong>The monsoon season in India usually starts from June and lasts till Mid-September.</strong> It is also named as the “South West Monsoon” season. When Monsoon season in India arrives after the tyrannical heat of the summer season in India, then greenery spreads all over. Cold winds run everywhere, crops flit in the fields, the faces of farmers begin to glow. People also enjoy the rain and cold air. The dark clouds run in the sky freely. It rains everywhere. Frogs croak in rainwater, farmers go out with their bullocks to plow their fields, nature seems to be very pleasant, cattle graze the fields with pleasure, peacocks dance after the rain, many insects take their birth, ants and lady velvety birds are seen all over the fields also we see grasshoppers, snakes, earthworms, etc. and many other beautiful things happen during this season. Also, there are some drawbacks from this season. Roads are covered with mud everywhere and it becomes difficult to walk on achcha roads and streets. The trade becomes dull, many businesses run in loss due to poor sales. Rivers and streams overflow and cause flood. Due to this, crops get destroyed, houses collapse, Kachcha houses leaks, no shelter for poor ones, and many other disasters transpire during this season. But also, this season can’t be blamed as it provides us food and most farmers are dependent on this season.
