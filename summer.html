        <strong>Out of four seasons, summer rules the hottest part.</strong>  Summer season in India starts in the month of March (end) and lasts until the end of May. In this period, the rays of the sun fall perpendicularly over the lands. That’s the reason most people avoid going out and getting tanned during day time. In late nights and early mornings, there would be a fall in temperature making a pleasant environment and during middays, there would be high temperature due to the intense heat outside. Thus, people use electric fans and air coolers to keep themselves chill during this time. During this period most of the schools and colleges are shut and vacations are provided to students. Thus, people love travelling to hill stations and beaches in this season to keep themselves cool and enjoy their vacation.
During this season rivers and tanks go dry. The scarcity of water is seen everywhere. Grass and leaves become withered. We find cattle grazing drylands. This can be one of the reasons why people hate this season. Despite all these, summer season in India is the best season for fruits such as mangoes, oranges, peach, watermelons, and other tasty fruits that people love to eat. Thus, summer is the season where people begin to battle it’s heat and other difficulties. There is also a convectional rain that occurs in this season.
